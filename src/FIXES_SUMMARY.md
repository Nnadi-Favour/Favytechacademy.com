# Fixes Applied - Favo Tech Academy

## Errors Fixed

### 1. ❌ Error: "You should call navigate() in a React.useEffect(), not when your component is first rendered"

**Root Cause:** The `navigate()` function was being called during component render in both StudentDashboard and AdminDashboard components.

**Files Fixed:**
- `/components/fta-pages/StudentDashboard.tsx`
- `/components/fta-pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`

**Solution:**
Moved the authentication check and navigation to `useEffect` hooks to comply with React's rules.

**Before:**
```typescript
export function StudentDashboard() {
  const { user, logout } = useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  if (!user || user.role !== 'student') {
    navigate('/login');  // ❌ Called during render
    return null;
  }
  // ... rest of component
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export function StudentDashboard() {
  const { user, logout } = useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user || user.role !== 'student') {
      navigate('/login');  // ✅ Called in useEffect
    }
  }, [user, navigate]);

  if (!user || user.role !== 'student') {
    return null;  // Early return for rendering
  }
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 2. ❌ Error: "Message getPage (id: 3) response timed out after 30000ms"

**Root Cause:** The timeout was likely caused by the navigation issue creating infinite re-renders, which prevented the page from loading properly.

**Solution:** Fixed by resolving the navigate() error above. No additional changes needed.
